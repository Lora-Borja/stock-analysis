# Stocks Analysis
### Overview of the project
Visual Basic for Applications is used in Excel to create macros in order to analyze multiple stocks data.
### Purpose
Using VBA macros in excel, the analysis of data is performed easily and efficiently on multiples stocks of data throughout various years. It allowed me to automate repetitive tasks in Excel and be able to output the analyses faster than using the excel functions. It also allowed me to learn the concept of coding by mapping out a plan of functions needed to get to the analysis results. With a laid out plan, I then was able to attempt to build the programming syntax to automate the tasks.

### Results
Stock performance of 2017 and 2018 Executed from the Refactored Script versus the Original Script:
* The runtime on both year's analysis took 0.1 seconds when executed on the refactored script
* The codes on a refactored script is much shorter and has a slight variance in syntax


* The runtime on both year's analysis took 0.8 seconds when executed using the original script
* The codes on the original script is longer and more detailed going through a step by step process

### Summary
One of the advantages of using the refactored script is that it made the macro run faster. Another advantage is that all of the tasks can be performed using one subroutine. Refactoring the codes allowed me to be able to take the existing written codes and re-design the programmed tasks to make one macro get to the same overall results. The codes can be written for all of the tasks needed on as long as you have structured them to run in the right order, which seemed to be more organized. Being new to VBA and coding in general, I found that in a refactored script it can be frustrating to figure out the coding on loops and nested loops if you've made an error. It can take some time to debug after you've made a mess of the refactored codes.

The original script was made with multiple sections to perform tasks separately so it seemed to be more stable. I was able to distinguish what the syntax of codes were related to each tasks, which allowed me to debug more comfortably than when I tried to debug on the refactored script. However, having separate codes for each tasks being executed meant the macro took longer to run. Although I felt more comfortable debugging in the original script, it also meant that there could be more codes to debug since there were more lines of codes to perform all the tasks. The original script also lacked structure compared to the refactored script since all the other tasks, such as static and conditional formatting were on a separate subroutine.
